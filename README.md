My attempt of using and modifying a macro keyboard

Using Retrobuilt Games Arduino project [here](http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/macro-keyboard-v2-0/macro-keyboard-v0-4/)

Parts:

- Version 0.4 of this [board](https://www.tindie.com/products/ryanbatesrbg/pcb-for-programmable-macro-keyboard-encoders-v2/)

***Link is to newer revision of board.***

- SparkFun Qwiic Pro Micro - USB-C (ATmega32U4) [Datasheet](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/1/1/1/4/QwiicProMicroUSB-C.pdf)

- Misc keyswitches from Aliexpress

...

## TODO

Board pseudo bricks when flashed with firmware.
Changing out Arduino's Keyboard.h to HID project breaks?
